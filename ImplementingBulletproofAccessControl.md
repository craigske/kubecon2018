# Implementing Bulletproof Access Control
Tinder - Johnathan Walker Senior Infra Sec Engineer

1. RBAC - def
    * additive perms
      * roles & role bindings by namespace
    * ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding
      * cluster scoped
    * Basics

2. Assigning Roles to Subjects
    * tinder is using EKS in prod
    * IAM Roles (federated)
    * dev -> read only
    * ops -> admin
    * security -> clusterAdmin

3. Advanced RBAC config

4. Tools
    * Aqua
      * easily manage roles directly in the console
      * fine grained access
    * (missed this)

Get slides. Adv RBAC looks interesting
